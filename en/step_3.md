## Getting the game assets

For this project, you're going to need a sprite and a background. You can download a zip file containing all the game assets by clicking [here](images/scratch_olympics_weightlifter.zip) and choosing to download the file. 

Once the file has been downloaded, you can unzip the archive by right-clicking on it and choosing `unzip`.

You should see two directories: one containing the weightlifter's costumes and the other containing the background.
